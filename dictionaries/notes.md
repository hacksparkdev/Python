# Dictionaries 

A dictionary in python is a collection of key-value paris. Each key is connected 
to a value, and you can use a key to accessthe value associate with that key.
A key's value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary. 
You can also use a object th you can create in python as a value in a dictionary.

A dictionary is wrapped in braces{} wit a series of key value paris inside the brace.
