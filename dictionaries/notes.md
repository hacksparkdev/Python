# Dictionaries 

A dictionary in python is a collection of key-value paris. Each key is connected 
to a value, and you can use a key to accessthe value associate with that key.
A key's value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary. 
You can also use a object th you can create in python as a value in a dictionary.

A dictionary is wrapped in braces{} wit a series of key value paris inside the brace.


## Creating a Dictionary

```
alient_0  = {

      "color"  :  "Green",
      "points" :  5
}

print(alient_0[color])
```

## Creating a Dictionary from empty list

```
alien_0 = {}

alien_0['color'] = 'penis'
alien_0['points'] = 5

print(alien_0)
```

## Modifying a Dict

```
alien_0 = {"color" : "red"}

print(f"The alien is {alien_0['color']}")

alien_0['color'] = "Green"

print(f"The alient is {alien_0['color']}")
```

- Here all we need is the key, then we assign the new value.
